            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Meron Weldselase, and I am currently a junior majoring in Computer Science. My dream is to become a skilled web developer, where I can design and create interactive and meaningful online experiences. I am passionate about technology and the endless possibilities it offers to solve problems and connect people globally.</p>
            <p>In addition to my studies, I enjoy spending my free time on a few favorite hobbies. I love reading books, especially related to psychology and personal development. Working out is another part of my routine, as it keeps me focused and energized.</p>
            <p>I enjoy spending quality time with my family and friends, who support and inspire me every day. My interests also include exploring new coding techniques, learning about software development trends, and staying curious about the world of technology.</p>

        <!-- My Avatar Section -->
        <section id="my-avatar">
           <h2>My Avatar: Lunaris, The Starbound Seeker</h2>
            <p>Let me introduce you to my avatar, Lunaris. Known as the "Starbound Seeker," Lunaris is a celestial wanderer, traveling through the cosmos in search of knowledge and mystery. This character embodies traits of resilience, curiosity, and wisdom, which I <em>admire</em> and strive to emulate in my journey as a Computer Science student.</p>
            <p>According to legend, Lunaris was born from a supernova, a brilliant explosion that lit up the galaxy. Since that cosmic event, Lunaris has been on an endless quest, using an enchanted Astral Compass to guide them to distant galaxies where rare knowledge and artifacts await discovery. Their cloak shimmers like a nebula, symbolizing the endless depths of space and the infinite paths that knowledge can take. Lunaris reminds me that, like the universe, learning is boundless, and there is always something new to explore.</p>
            <p>Lunarisâ€™s journey parallels my own experiences in web development, where I am constantly learning new concepts, facing challenges, and growing my skills. With Lunaris as my avatar, I feel inspired to push beyond my limits, embrace curiosity, and remember that every step, no matter how small, is part of a greater journey toward becoming a developer.</p>

        <!-- What I Have Learned in ITSE 1301 Section -->
        <section id="itse-1301">
            <h2>What I Have Learned in ITSE 1301</h2>
            <p>In this class, I am gaining foundational skills that are crucial for web development. This course focuses on the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are the backbone of web pages. I have learned to structure a page with essential HTML tags such as <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, and various semantic tags that make the content more organized and accessible.</p>
            <p>One of the key lessons in this class has been the importance of semantic HTML tags like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>. These tags not only improve the structure of the web page but also enhance accessibility, making it easier for screen readers and search engines to understand the content. I am also learning how to use inline elements like <em>emphasis</em> and <strong>strong</strong> to make certain parts of text stand out, adding meaning and readability to the content.</p>
            <p>This class has also introduced me to the importance of writing clean, well-formatted code. We use tools to validate our HTML code to ensure that it follows web standards and displays correctly across browsers. Each assignment brings new insights, and I am excited to continue building on these foundational skills, which are essential for creating user-friendly, well-structured websites.</p>
