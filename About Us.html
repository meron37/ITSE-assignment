                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello, my name is Meron Weldselase, and I am currently a junior majoring in Computer Science. My dream is to become a skilled web developer, where I can design and create interactive and meaningful online experiences. I am passionate about technology and the endless possibilities it offers to solve problems and connect people globally.</p>
                <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy exploring new technologies and keeping up with trends in web development. I take pride in solving challenges through programming and experimenting with various tools to build projects that bring ideas to life. This passion drives me to grow and learn every day.</p>
                <p>In my free time, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and collaborating with peers to exchange ideas and refine my skills. These experiences have not only enriched my knowledge but also helped me understand the value of teamwork and communication in achieving success.</p>

                <h1>What I Have Learned in ITSE 1301</h1>
                <p>This course has been a transformative journey that introduced me to the fundamentals of web development. I gained a solid understanding of HTML and CSS, which allowed me to create visually appealing and user-friendly web pages. Learning the W3.CSS framework was particularly beneficial for designing responsive layouts efficiently.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I learned how to validate my code to ensure it meets industry standards for accessibility and functionality. Tools like the HTML and CSS validators helped me identify and fix issues, enhancing the quality of my website. Debugging became an essential part of the process, teaching me to approach problems systematically.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most valuable lesson was the importance of cohesive design and user experience. From navigation menus to color palettes, I learned how to maintain consistency across all pages of a website. These skills will undoubtedly support my professional aspirations as a web developer.</p>
